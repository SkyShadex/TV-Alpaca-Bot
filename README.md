# Trade Execution Framework

Welcome to my automated trading framework, a project that started as a small interest and has grown into a full-fledged framework that has inspired me to change careers. This system is designed to connect TradingView to various brokers, enabling fully automated trading strategies.

## Overview

Initially, the project was intended to connect TradingView to Alpaca. Over time, I expanded it to push orders to MetaTrader 5 via Socket. As my programming skills improved, I refined the framework to work exclusively with Alpaca. This journey has not only deepened my understanding of programming but also enhanced my knowledge of financial systems, risk management, and data analysis.

### Key Features
- **TradingView Integration**: Connect TradingView alerts to Alpaca.
- **Broker Support**: Extensible to support various brokers, with a primary focus on Alpaca.
- **Automated Trading**: Fully automate trading strategies with robust order execution.

### Skills and Technologies

Throughout this project, I have acquired and honed skills in:
- **Programming**: Developing in complex algorithms and improving code efficiency. Python and C++.
- **Networking**: Establishing secure connections between different systems.
- **System Administration**: Managing and configuring servers to ensure reliable operation.
- **Data Engineering**: Handling and processing large datasets efficiently.
- **Financial Systems**: Understanding and implementing trading strategies and risk management.
- **Time Series Data Analysis**: Analyzing financial data for informed decision-making.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to optimize trading performance.

### Current Tasks
- **Performance Optimization**: Improve the performance of compute-intensive strategies and components.
- **Redis Integration**: Integrate RedisDB to cache price data, reducing API calls while maintaining a suitable dataset.
- **Dockerization**: Fully Dockerize the project (currently running from VSCode inside Docker).
